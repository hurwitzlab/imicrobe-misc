The lobster was held at 4C until moribund (4 weeks). Hemolymph containing ciliates was removed (1 ml aliquots) and cultured in ATCC1651 MA medium overnight to allow contaminating hemocytes and debris to adhere to the plastic containers. Ciliates (6,000 cells/ml) were transferred to fresh media and grown to sufficient density (109, 000 cells/ml). Cells were then washed with fresh artificial seawater (FASW) and resuspended in FASW at a density of 12,500 cells/ml and starved for 11 days. RNA was extracted by RNeasy kit with DNAse1 treatment and quantified by Nanodrop and quality assessed by Bioanlyzer.","18s_rrna":"AACCTGGTTGATCCTGCCAGTAGTCATATGCTTGTCTCAAAGATTAAGCCATGCATGTCTAAGTATAAAT\nAGTATACAGTGAAACTGCGAATGGCTCATTAAAACAGTTATAGTTTATTTGATAATGGAAAGCTACATGG\nATAACCGTGGTAATTCTAGAGCTAATACATGCTGTCAAACCCGACTTTTTGGAAGGGTTGTATTTATTAG\nATATTAAGCCAATATTCCTTGTGTCTATTGTGGTGAATCATAGTAACTGATCGAATCCCTTTTTGTGGAT\nAAATCATTCAAGTTTCTGCCCTATCAGCTTTCGATGGTAGTGTATTGGACTACCATGGCAGTCACGGGTA\nACGGAGAATTAGGGTTCGGTTCCGGAGAGGGAGCCTGAGAAACGGCTACCACATCTAAGGAAGGCAGCAG\nGCGCGTAAATTACCCAATCCTGATTCAGGGAGGTAGTGACAAGAAATAACAACCTGGGGGAATTTATTCC\nTTACGGGATTGCAATGAGAACAATTTAAACGACTTATCGAGGAACAATTGGAGGGCAAGTCTGGTGCCAG\nCAGCCGCGGTAATTCCAGCTCCAATAGCGTATATTAAAGTTGTTGCAGTTAAAAAGCTCGTAGTTGAATT\nTCTGCGTATGCCTAGTTCTGGCTTTGGTCAAGCTAGTGTGTGCGCATCCGCTTGCAAATCCGGACCGGCG\nTTTACTCGTCGACCGGGGGAGTAGGCCCTTTACCTTGAAAAAATTAGAGTGTTTCAGGCAGGCAATGGCT\nCGAATACATTAGCATGGAATAATAGAATAGGACTTTTGTCTATTTGGTTGGTTATTAGACATGAGTAATG\nATTAAAAGGGACAGTTGGGGGCATTAGTATTTAATAGTCAGAGGTAAAATTCTTGGATTTATTAAAGACT\nAACTTATGCGAAAGCATTTGCCAAGGATGTTTTCATTAATCAAGAACGAAAGTTAGGGGATCAAAGACGA\nTCAGATACCGTCCTAGTCTTAACTATAAACTATACCGACTCGGAATCGGGCAGGCTTATAAATCTTGCTC\nGGCGCCGTATGAGAAATCAAAGTCTTTGGGTTCTGGGGGGAGTATGGTCGCAAGGCTGAAACTTAAAGGA\nATTGACGGAAGGGCACCACCAGGCGTGGAGCCTGCGGCTTAATTTGACTCAACACGGGGAAACTTACCAG\nGTCCAAACATGGGTGGGATTGACAGATTGAGAGCTCTTTCTTGATCCTATGGGTGGTGGTGCATGGCCGT\nTCTTAGTTGGTGGAGTGATTTGTCTGGTTAATTCCGTTAACGAACGAGACCTTAACCTGCTAAATAGTAC\nGTTGATGCATAATTGGCGTTACTTCTTAGAGGGACTATGCGCTTTGAAACGCATGGAAGTTTGAGGCAAT\nAACAGGTCTGTGATGCCCTTAGATGTCCTGGGCCGCACGCGCGCTACAATGACTCACTCAGAAAGTATTT\nCCTGGCCCGGAAGGGTTCAGGGTAATCTTCATAATATGAGTCGTGTTAGGGATCGATCTTTGCAATTATA\nGATCTTGAACGAGGAATGCCTAGTAAGTGCAAGTCATCAGCTTGTACTGATTACGTCCCTGCCCTTTGTA\nCACACCGCCCGTCGCTCCTACCGATTTCGAGTGATCCGGTGAACCTTCTGGACTGAAGTCATTTATGACA\nTTGGGAAGTTAAGTAAACCTAATCACTTAGAGGAAGGAGAAGTCGTAACAAGGTTTCCGTAGGTGAACCT\nGCAGAAGGATC","latitude":"43.51667","sample_accession_number":"CAM_SMPL_002585","experimental_salinity":"30","project_id":104,"sample_material":"lobster hemolymph containing the cliate was cultured in the media listed above.
