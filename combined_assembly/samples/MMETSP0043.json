{"importance":"Cryptomonads are aquatic unicellular eukaryotes that acquired photosynthesis through secondary endosymbiosis with a red algae. They are a key group to understand the origin and spread of photosynthesis among eukaryotes, but too few sequence data exist to properly address this question. The nucleomorph genome of H. andersenii has been sequenced, the nucleus transcriptome will nicely complement the existing data.","prelim_ncbi_taxon_id":"464988","habitat":"marine habitat","growth_medium":"K medium","sample_collection_site":"Gulf of Mexico","country":"UNITED STATES","ph":"7.5","external_sample_id":"Ha1","ncgr_sample_id":"MMETSP0043_2","species":"andersenii","other_environmental_metadata_available":"Gulf Stream","date_of_experiment":"01-OCT-10","trace_elements":"14.09","sample_material":"net tow","modifications_to_growth_medium":"without SiO2","strain":"CCMP644","principle_investigator":"John Archibald","experimental_temperature":"17","axenic":"No","combined_assembly_name":"N/A","nitrate":"882","genus":"Hemiselmis","phosphate":"10","experimental_salinity":"30","sample_accession_number":"CAM_SMPL_002351","day_portion_of_day_night_cycle_in_hours":"6","project_id":104,"clonal":"Unknown","night_portion_of_day_night_cycle_in_hours":"18","18s_rrna":"tagtgtaaataactcttatgaaactgcgaatggctcattaaatcagttatcgtttatttgatggtctcttactacatggataaccgtagtaattctagagctaatacatgcacaaaggctcgactcacgaagagctgtatttattagattcaaagccgaccttgttttggtgattcataataacttttcgaacctcatgcccttgcggtggaggtgattcattcaaatttctgccctatcaactttcgatggtag","assembly_accession_number":"CAM_ASM_000169","primary_citation":"Lane,C.E.& Archibald,J.M.
